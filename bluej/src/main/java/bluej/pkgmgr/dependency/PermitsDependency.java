/**
 * A permits dependency.
 * 
 * Permits dependencies are a little odd.  Let's imagine we have:
 *   sealed class Parent permits Child
 *   final class Child extends Parent
 * We will have an ExtendsDependency from Child to Parent, and a
 * PermitsDependency from Parent to Child.  Despite going in opposite directions, 
 * both will have the same effect: when Parent gets marked as needing 
 * recompile, Child will be a dependent and also get marked.
 * 
 * So, why need both?  Is Extends not enough?  The reason is that it is possible
 * to be in this state:
 *   sealed class Parent permits Child
 *   final class Child
 * In this case, changing Parent should require compiling Child (which needs
 * to fix up its dependencies) but without the ExtendsDependency, Child will not
 * get recompiled.  So we use the PermitsDependency to make sure Child is compiled too.
